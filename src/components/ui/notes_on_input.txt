// This file is just to satisfy the user's import casing if I wanted to, 
// but I will rewrite the imports in page.tsx to point to correct files.
// However, the prompts 'Input' usage might have custom props?
// User code: <Input label="Date & Time" ... />
// Shadcn Input doesn't have 'label' prop. It's usually Label + Input.
// I need to create a wrapper or modify the user's code to usage standard shadcn components.
// I will create a wrapper `Input.tsx` that *exports* a component with a label prop, 
// but wait, I already have `ui/input.tsx`. 
// Writing over it might break other things.
// I will creating `src/components/ui/CustomInput.tsx` and mapping the user's code to it.
